Idle
====

Idle is a simple langauge or format for describing modules and data structures.

It's meant to be used as an
[interface description language (IDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language)
that isn't tied to any speicific language, protocol, or convention.

It doesn't do much on its own (hence the name), and relies on external tools
to interpret the data and generate code.
